Marketing Mix Model
  This project involves scripting data for 24 months for 1000 physicians. This project was to determine what an appropriate marketing 
  strategy is to increase scripting from previous detailing (visits from salesman). Some techniques used were regression analysis, 
  time lagged variables, and fixed time effects / fixed physician.
